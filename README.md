# Why I Even Made This
I have never done TypeScript and it seems that this repository is a good place to practice it.
# Installing and Running This
1. Clone this repository with `git clone https://github.com/hueychen27/TypeScript-Test`.
2. Install ts-node with `sudo npm install -g ts-node`.
3. Run the shapes.tsx file with `ts-node shapes.tsx`.
